# PSDM

The Pore and Surface Diffusion Model (PSDM) was converted into Python from the Fortran version used in AdDesignS(TM) from the **Environmental Technologies Design Option Tool** (ETDOT) from Michigan Technological University (MTU). (v1.0 - D.R. Hokanson, D.W. Hand, J.C. Crittenden, T.N. Rogers, E.J. Oman)

3 Python files are used in this tool.

* PSDM.py
* PSDM_functions.py (automatically imported by PSDM.py)
* PSDM_tools.py (must import to access additional capabilities)

See [Example_TCE.py](Example_TCE.py) for a few basic examples of how to run the PSDM code. (Example_TCE.xlsx is the input file for this example.)

See [Example_Multi.py](Example_Multi.py) for using the multi-component competitive capability (Example_Multi.xlsx is the example input.)

See [Example_isotherm.py](Example_isotherm.py) for using the isotherm fitting function.

Additional functions are available - Examples/documentation will be available in the future.

# Installation

Provided the dependencies in [setup.py](setup.py) are satisfied, this package can be installed from the command line:
```
python -m pip install /path/to/PSDM
```

if you are in the Water_Treatment_Models/PSDM/ folder, then you can also use:
```
python -m pip install .
```


The package can also be uninstalled from the command line:
```
python -m pip uninstall PSDM
```

IF you would like to use the lead-lag capabilities within the PSDM module, you must also install the [IonExchangeModel](https://github.com/USEPA/Water_Treatment_Models/tree/master/IonExchangeModel) to get ixpy.
